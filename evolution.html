                The history of video games spans over several decades and has gone through remarkable transformations 
                in technology, storytelling, and interactivity. 
                
                    <h3>The Early Beginnings (1940s - 1950s)</h3> 
                  
                    <ul> 
                        <li>1947: Cathode-Ray Tube Amusement Device—often considered the first electronic game—was 
                            created by Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr. and Estle Ray Mann. It was a simple missile simulator.</li>
                        <li> 1952: OXO (a variation of Tic-Tac-Toe) was developed by A.S. Douglas on the EDSAC computer. 
                            It was the first known video game to be played on a graphical screen.</li>
                    </ul> 
                    Impact: Early video games were seen as experimental projects in universities and research labs.
                    These games were not available to the general public but laid the foundation for future developments
